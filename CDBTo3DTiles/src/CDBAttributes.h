CDB readers should default to a value of 0.000 if AO1 is missing. Applicable to Point, Light Point, Moving Model Location and Figure Point features.

BBH refers to height of the box above the XY plane of the model, BBW refers to the width of the box along the X-axis, and BBL refers to the length of the box along the Y-axis. Note that for 3D models used as cultural features, the XY plane of the model corresponds to its ground reference plane. The value of BBH, BBW and BBL should be accounted for by client-devices (in combination with other information) to determine the appropriate distance at which the model should be paged-in, rendered or processed. BBH, BBW and BBL are usually generated through database authoring tool automation. Optional on features for which a MODL has been assigned.

A value of 100% corresponds to the highest importance; a value of 0% corresponds to the lowest importance. When confronted with otherwise identical objects that differ only wrt to their RelativeTActical Importance, client-devices should always discard features with lower importance before those of higher importance in the course of performing their scene / load management function. As a result, a value of zero gives complete freedom to client-devices to discard the feature as soon as the load of the client-device is exceeded. The effectiveness of scene / load management functions can be severely hampered if large quantities of features are assigned the same Relative TActical Importance by the modeler. In effect, if all models are assigned the same value, the client-devices have no means to distinguish tactically important objects from each other. Assigning a value of 1% to all objects is equivalent to assigning them all a value of 99%. Ideally, the assignment of tactical importance to features should be in accordance to a histogram similar to the one shown here. The shape of the curve is not critical, however the proportion of models tagged with a high importance compared to those with low importance is critical in achieving effective scene/load management schemes. It is illustrated here to show that few models should have an importance of 100 with progressively more models with lower importance. The assignment of the RTAI to each feature lends itself to database tools automation. For instance, RTAI could be based on a look-up function which factors the featureâ€™s type (FACC or MMDC). The value of Relative TActical Importance should be accounted for by client-devices (in combination with other information) to determine the appropriate distance at which the model should be rendered or processed. Relative TActical Importance is mandatory. It has no default value.";
